# Introduction
We are diverse group of innovators, who met at Harvard during grad school and bonded as sport fans who decided to create an AI-based multi-sport analytics platform (“AlphaPlay”) so that players/managers could study the AI’s insights to improve their play/team. After months of building this system and successfully submitting it as our capstone thesis, this summer, we began sharing AlphaPlay with a select group of NBA and MLB insiders. 

# Methodology  
AlphaPlay is a combination of statistical/algorithmic/scalability/software techniques that draws on our combined industry experience (tech/finance/medicine/academia) to, in a way unique to the sports industry, extract interpretable importance to certain statistics.  Specifically, it uses advanced feature engineering (so AlphaPlay can better learn the sport’s nuances), a combination of AI/ML algos (boosting, trees, neural nets) and a regularized solution applying cooperative game theory concepts to identify desirable properties. 

# Results
The resulting AI-generated analytics produced by AlphaPlay are presented through web-based, interactive software. Below is a screenshot of the AlphaPlay analyzing an upcoming NBA game.  These analytics are a unique breakdown for each game (either past or future), allowing for testing of lineup permutations, quantifying the impact of minutes played for load management, quantitatively assessing in-game tactics/strategies, analyzing how free-agents/trades would impact a team, to name a few things that experts have noted in our demos.

# Conclusion
The application of AI to the sports industry is in its early stages, in part evidenced by the list of practical uses for AlphaPlay growing with each demo.  We expect to the work use this system in many sports to put AI explainability and practicality before complexity to assist players/teams in making more optimal, data-driven decisions. Enjoy!
